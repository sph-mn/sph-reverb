# late-field spatial model
the late kernel must encode full position dependence, not a post-gain remapping
the fdn state must possess spatial structure that couples to source and channel positions
delays require abstract coordinates to support directional coupling
spatial domain chosen as [-1,1]^d for unity across positions, channels, and state directions
unit-normalized vectors represent directions; delay length encodes path time
residues alpha_kc depend on state_excitation b(p) and state_projection c_c(p,x_c)
these must be full vectors over delay lines to influence modal shapes

## option - selected
directional state model
* assign each delay a direction s_i in [-1,1]^d with norm 1
* build b as lobe over dot(u_p,s_i)
* build c_c as lobe over dot(u_c,s_i) scaled by pan law g_c
* pros: consistent with diffuse-field physics; non-separable modal residues; smooth spatial continuity
* cons: requires per-delay direction data; eigenvector-based residues needed

## option
position-only gain model
* define g_c(p) and multiply mono late field
* pros: trivial implementation; no fdn modification
* cons: collapses spatial structure; does not affect modal excitation; discarded

## option
geometric wall mapping
* assign delay positions from real room geometry
* pros: physically interpretable
* cons: requires room model; not aligned with abstract fdn topology; unnecessarily complex for late

# why is it important that state directions encode late-field propagation directions, not room surfaces
It matters because it guarantees that the late field stays physically correct for late reverberation and does not collapse into a fake geometric early-reflection model.

The reasons are structural:

* Late reverberation is dominated by *directional diffusion*, not by the *specific positions* of room surfaces.
* After a sufficient number of reflections, the sound field loses memory of the individual walls and becomes approximately isotropic and homogeneous.
* What still matters in the late field is:

* how energy flows between directions,
* how directional components decay,
* how source and listener positions couple into those directional components.

If the delay lines carried “wall positions”, then:

* you would be forcing a geometric interpretation appropriate only for early reflections
* high-order reflections would incorrectly preserve spatial detail that does not exist in real rooms
* the modal system would inherit non-physical asymmetries
* residues could encode spurious wall-like structure instead of late-field structure
* the FDN would behave like a low-order geometric reflector bank, not a diffuser

By encoding *directions* instead of *surfaces*:

* the FDN state becomes a discretization of the diffuse wave field
  (a set of directional energy components)
* eigenmodes v_k, w_k reflect the long-term mixing dynamics, not wall layout
* b(p) and c_c(p, x_c) couple source and channels into that directional field exactly where position matters for late reverberation
* residues alpha_kc vary with direction, position, and modal structure in a physically meaningful way
* early geometry remains the job of the early-reflection algorithm, without contaminating the late stage

In short:

Using *state directions* matches the physics of the late field.
Using *state wall positions* would misrepresent the physics and corrupt the modal decomposition.

# difference between early and late reflections
early:
* finite set of low-order paths with exact times and amplitudes
* direct computational geometry (image sources, ray tracing)

late:
* dense set of high-order paths compressed into a small set of delays + mixing
* geometry only enters statistically via s_i, band filters, and mixing
* modalization gives you the exact linear response of that compressed model

# should it depend on sph-sp
## option - chosen
no. the project will be more useful if it is independent of sph-sp, which is easily achievable
